# These scripts are DEPRECATED

This folder contains legacy CI scripts that are **no longer maintained** by the Infracost team.
These scripts will be removed **September 2022**.

These scripts have now replaced by dedicated integrations with most CI/CD platforms. Please visit [infracost.io/cicd/](https://www.infracost.io/cicd/) for more information.

If you're still using one of these scripts, you can find detailed migration guides in our docs for the following platforms:

* [GitHub Actions](https://www.infracost.io/docs/guides/actions_migration/)
* [GitLab CI](https://www.infracost.io/docs/guides/gitlab_ci_migration/)
