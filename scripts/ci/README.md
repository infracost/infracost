# These scripts are DEPRECATED

This folder contains legacy CI scripts that are **no longer maintained** by the Infracost team. These script have been replaced by dedicated integrations with most CI/CD platforms, which we recommend you upgrade to:
* [GitHub Actions](https://www.infracost.io/docs/guides/actions_migration/)
* [GitLab CI](https://www.infracost.io/docs/guides/gitlab_ci_migration/)
* [Atlantis](https://www.infracost.io/docs/guides/atlantis_migration/)
* [Azure DevOps](https://www.infracost.io/docs/guides/azure_devops_migration/)

Please visit [Infracost.io/cicd](https://www.infracost.io/cicd/) for other CI/CD integrations and more information.

These scripts will be removed **September 2022**. If you are pulling them directly from this repository and cannot upgrade before then, we recommend you keep a copy in your own repositories.
