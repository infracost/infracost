Infracost shows cloud cost estimates for Terraform. It enables DevOps, SRE and engineers to see a cost breakdown and understand costs **before making changes**, either in the terminal or pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

## Quick start

### 1. Install Infracost

Assuming [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) is already installed, get the latest Infracost release:

macOS Homebrew:
```sh
brew install infracost
```

Linux/macOS manual download:
```sh
# Downloads the CLI based on your OS/arch and puts it in /usr/local/bin
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracost/infracost/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Docker and Windows users see [here](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start).

### 2. Get API key

Register for a free API key, which is used by the CLI to query our Cloud Pricing API, e.g. get prices for instance types. No cloud credentials or secrets are [sent](https://www.infracost.io/docs/faq/#what-data-is-sent-to-the-cloud-pricing-api) to the API and you can also self-host it. 

```sh
infracost register
```

The key can be retrieved with `infracost configure get api_key`.

### 3. Run it

Infracost does not make any changes to your Terraform state or cloud resources. Run Infracost using our example Terraform project to see how it works:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/infracost/example-terraform.git
cd example-terraform/sample1

# Play with main.tf and re-run to compare costs
infracost breakdown --path .

# Show diff of monthly costs, edit the yml file and re-run to compare costs
infracost diff --path . --sync-usage-file --usage-file infracost-usage.yml
```

Screenshots of example outputs are [shown below](#cli-commands).

### 4. Add to CI/CD

Use our CI/CD integrations to add cost estimates to pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can understand cloud costs upfront, and discuss them as part of your workflow.
- [GitHub Actions](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/github_actions/)
- [GitLab CI](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/gitlab_ci/)

Other CI/CD systems can be supported using [our Docker images](/docs/integrations/cicd/#docker-images). If you run into any issues, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'd be happy to help!

## CLI commands

The `infracost` CLI has the following main commands, see [our docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/) for the other commands:

#### Show full breakdown of costs

<img src=".github/assets/breakdown_screenshot.png" alt="Infracost breakdown command" width=600 />

#### Show diff of monthly costs between current and planned state

<img src=".github/assets/diff_screenshot.png" alt="Infracost diff command" width=600 />

## Supported clouds and resources

Infracost supports over **200** Terraform resources across [AWS](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/aws), [Azure](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/azure) and [Google](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/google). Other IaC tools, such as [Pulumi](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/187), [AWS CloudFormation/CDK](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/190) and [Azure ARM/Bicep](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/812) are on our roadmap.

See [this page](https://www.infracost.io/docs/usage_based_resources) for details on cost estimation of usage-based resources such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Storage.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome! For development details, see the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide. For major changes, including CLI interface changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
