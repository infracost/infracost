## Get started

Follow our [**quick start guide**](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) to get started with the CLI üöÄ

Infracost has many [CI/CD integrations](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/cicd/) so you can easily post cost estimates in pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

#### Post cost estimates in pull requests
