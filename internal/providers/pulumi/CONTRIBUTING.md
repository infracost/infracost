# Contributing to the pulumi provider

## notes

1. The current pulumi provider uses the json preview digest, it is generated by `pulumi preview --show-sames -j > preview.json`
2. `parsePreviewDigest` in parser.go is where all of the parsing code exists.
3. We currently skip `stacks` and `awsx` components.
4. The `localInputs` map gets turned into a `gjson.Result` to enable all of the following code to execute `.Get("key")` on it.
5. `parseRegion` and `parseTags` both have provider based switches that call functions in the provider library  
6. `Step.Op` determines whether the resource currently exists or not.
7. To keep the existing names in all of the registryItems we use a function `deriveTfResourceTypes` which derives the library name from the pulumi name.
8. If it is a free resource do not add it to the function above, just duplicate the name in `(aws|azure|google)/registry.go` in type: `FreeResources`
