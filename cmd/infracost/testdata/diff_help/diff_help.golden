USAGE
  infracost diff [flags]

EXAMPLES
  Use Terraform directory with any required flags:

      infracost diff --path /path/to/code --terraform-plan-flags "-var-file=my.tfvars"

  Use Terraform plan JSON:

      terraform plan -out tfplan.binary
      terraform show -json tfplan.binary > plan.json
      infracost diff --path plan.json

FLAGS
      --config-file string            Path to Infracost config file. Cannot be used with path, terraform* or usage-file flags
      --hcl-only                      Run infracost without terraform, parsing hcl files at the given path. This option does not need credentials and is much quicker to run.
