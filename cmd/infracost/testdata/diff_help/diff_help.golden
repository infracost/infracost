Show diff of monthly costs between current and planned state

USAGE
  infracost diff [flags]

EXAMPLES
  Use Terraform directory with any required flags:

      infracost diff --path /path/to/code --terraform-plan-flags "-var-file=my.tfvars"

  Use Terraform plan JSON:

      terraform plan -out tfplan.binary
      terraform show -json tfplan.binary > plan.json
      infracost diff --path plan.json

FLAGS
      --config-file string            Path to Infracost config file. Cannot be used with path, terraform* or usage-file flags
      --hcl-only                      Run infracost without terraform, parsing hcl files at the given path. This option does not need credentials and is much quicker to run. (experimental)
  -h, --help                          help for diff
      --no-cache                      Don't attempt to cache Terraform plans
      --out-file string               Save output to a file
  -p, --path string                   Path to the Terraform directory or JSON/plan file
      --show-skipped                  Show unsupported resources
      --sync-usage-file               Sync usage-file with missing resources, needs usage-file too (experimental)
      --terraform-plan-flags string   Flags to pass to 'terraform plan'. Applicable when path is a Terraform directory
      --terraform-workspace string    Terraform workspace to use. Applicable when path is a Terraform directory
      --usage-file string             Path to Infracost usage file that specifies values for usage-based resources
      --var strings                   Can only be used with --hcl-only. Set a value for one of the input variables in the root module
                                      of the terraform configuration. Use this option more than once to set more than one variable. (experimental)
      --var-file strings              Can only be used with --hcl-only. Load variable values from the given file, in addition
                                      to the default files terraform.tfvars and *.auto.tfvars. Use this option more than once to
                                      include more than one variables file. (experimental)
