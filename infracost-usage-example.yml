# You can use this file to define resource usage estimates for Infracost to use when calculating
# the cost of usage-based resource, such as AWS Lambda.
# `infracost breakdown --usage-file infracost-usage.yml [other flags]`
# See https://infracost.io/usage-file/ for docs
version: 0.1
resource_usage:

  # Usage for resources inside modules can be specified using the full path of the resource.
  # This is the same value as Infracost outputs in the Name column, for example:
  #
  # module.my_module.aws_dynamodb_table.my_table:
  #   storage_gb: 1000
  # module.lambda_function.aws_lambda_function.this[0]:
  #   monthly_requests: 20000
  #   request_duration_ms: 600
  #
  # The wildcard character `[*]` can be used for an array of resources. Infracost will apply
  # the usage values individually to each element of the array. If an array element
  # (e.g. `this[0]`) and `[*]` are specified for a resource, only the array element's usage
  # will be applied to that resource. This enables you to define default values using `[*]`
  # and override specific elements using their index.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # aws_cloudwatch_log_group.my_log_group[*]:
  #   storage_gb: 1000
  #   monthly_data_ingested_gb: 1000
  #   monthly_data_scanned_gb: 200
